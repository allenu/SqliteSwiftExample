# SqliteSwiftExample

This is an example I put together of a table view sourcing its data from a SQLite database, using SQLite.swift cocoapod.

I'm trying to get a feel for how to handle:
- caching only a small number of SQLite rows in memory at a time
- handling pagination of an NSTableView
- live insertions of new rows
